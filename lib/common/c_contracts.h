 * Annotations that vanish under a compiler that does not understand them.
 *
 * This header is the annotation language. The contract grammar it expands to is
 * one of three targets, chosen at include time:
 *
 *   contract-aware front end   __has_feature(c_contracts): pre/post/assigns
 *   CBMC directly              -DC_CONTRACTS_CPROVER: __CPROVER_requires etc.
 *   everything else            nothing at all
 *
 * Annotated source stays buildable by GCC, MSVC, tcc and stock clang, at any
 * standard level from C89 on, with no second code path -- every target produces
 * the same declaration.
 *
 * This file is self-contained and intended to be vendored: copy it into a
 * project rather than depending on a particular compiler shipping it. It is
 * written in C89 with no includes so that it cannot constrain what includes it.
 *
 * No variadic macros are used, so -std=c89 -pedantic stays quiet. c_locations
 * combines two frame locations and nests when a frame needs more.

 *   goto-instrument --enforce-contract f f.goto f-chk.goto

 * Everything in the language survives this mode, but only through the c_ names.
 * The bare spellings a contract-aware front end also accepts -- readable, old,
 * result, a p[lo : hi] range, forall (i : lo, hi) P -- are grammar rather than
 * macros, and nothing discards them here. Write c_readable, c_same_object,
